                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p>There were a variety of ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of them
                    and he could see what
                    his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game
                    should be his. He
                    began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand
                    times in the past.
                    So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated
                    to easily defeat
                    him in the game.</p>

                <p>I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." That is if we wanted to drown
                    ourselves in a sea
                    of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in
                    the determination
                    that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is
                    actually meant to be
                    doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the
                    cookie crumbles. And
                    now I want a cookie.</p>

                <p>Eating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. "It's a delicacy in Japan," didn't seem to make it any
                    more appetizing.
                    Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not.</p>

                <p>The coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. It reached its peak and began to descend.
                    Both boys were
                    pleading with it to land a certain way but the coin had already made up its mind on what it was
                    going to do.</p>

                <p>It was going to rain. The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He
                    had learned over the
                    years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and
                    prepare.</p>
